## How to use in your own project

To get started, it's easiest to take a look at the ["record" example] as well as the [app itself]. The app is a minimalist yet full-fledged CLI chat application that can connect using a SOCKS5 proxy. The ["record" example] waits for a connection and then records all messages received within a few seconds in a Vec.

  [app itself]: src/app.rs
